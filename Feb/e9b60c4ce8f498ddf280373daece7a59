JSE-listed real estate&nbsp;investment trust Redefine Properties has announced a number of changes to its board and board committees, in line with its gender diversity goals. Independent nonexecutive director G&uuml;nter&nbsp;Steffens and&nbsp;nonexecutive director Mike Watters will step down from the board at the company&#39;s annual general meeting in February.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Both Steffens and Watters have served the board with distinction and the company has greatly benefited from their invaluable experience and wealth of knowledge. On behalf of the board, I wish to extend our sincerest gratitude to both for their significant contributions to&nbsp;the Redefine&nbsp;board over the past few years. I wish them the very best,&rdquo; CEO&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;Konig said on Friday. &nbsp; Executive directors David Rice and Mike Ruttell, who is also a member of the social and ethics committee, will also step down from the board in February, but will remain members of the company&rsquo;s senior executive management leadership team and as standing invitees to meetings of the board. &nbsp; At that time, Bridgitte Matthews&nbsp;will join&nbsp;the&nbsp;board as&nbsp;an independent nonexecutive director and as a member and chairperson&nbsp;of the remuneration committee and as a member of the nomination committee. Independent nonexecutive directors Phumzile Langeni will take over as chairperson of the audit and risk committee and Nomalizo Langa-Royds as chairperson of the social and ethics committee. &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are serious about equity and diversity.&nbsp;Redefine is centered on people and we remain committed to fostering and supporting&nbsp;diversity and skilled leadership at all levels in the organisation,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Konig. &nbsp;

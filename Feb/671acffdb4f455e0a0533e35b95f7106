International airline Lufthansa&rsquo;s new direct year-round flight between Frankfurt and Cape Town is scheduled to arrive in Cape Town on Saturday morning. Passengers on this flight will enjoy a newly retrofitted Airbus A340-300, which boasts 279 seats and offers the airline&rsquo;s new intercontinental business class, the new premium economy class and economy class. &nbsp; This route, which will run three times a week in its first year of service, signifies the importance of Cape Town to the Lufthansa group, which also flies seasonally from Munich and Zurich to Cape Town.&nbsp; With the arrival of the new Frankfurt&ndash;Cape Town service, Lufthansa will now serve South Africa with up to 24 weekly flights during the peak travel season. &nbsp; &ldquo;For nearly six decades, Lufthansa has connected Africa to the rest of the world and South Africa as a key market remains a strategic focus for the group. Cape Town has risen significantly in global rankings as a preferred destination for both leisure and business travellers and we plan to extend the service to five weekly flights in the Europe winter season of 2017/18,&rdquo; says Lufthansa sales VP for Africa and the Middle East Tamur Goudarzi-Pour. &nbsp; He adds that the overwhelming demand for a year-round route to South Africa&rsquo;s Mother City has presented a sound business case for expanding Lufthansa&rsquo;s service to this route, which is a rare case in an economic environment where many European airlines are reviewing the viability of routes and scaling back. &ldquo;Lufthansa is proud to offer Cape Town and the [Western Cape] province a direct route to Europe through our internationally rated Frankfurt hub, which connects travellers to over 200 destinations globally,&rdquo; says Goudarzi-Pour. &nbsp;

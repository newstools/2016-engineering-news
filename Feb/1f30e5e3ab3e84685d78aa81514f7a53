Sasol Group Technology, a division of the Sasol group, has contracted construction company Fluor Corporation to oversee engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) of the additional oxygen capacity train 17 outside battery limits project at its Secunda plant, in Mpumalanga. Fluor will book the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter of 2016. The project comprises the construction and commissioning of the world&rsquo;s largest air separation unit (ASU), with Fluor also overseeing the integration of train 17&rsquo;s product streams with other live operations. This includes high-pressure oxygen, high-pressure and low-pressure nitrogen as well as dry air. Also included in the scope of works is the supply of electricity with associated infrastructure and utilities upgrades to the ASU. &ldquo;This award will allow Fluor to demonstrate its integrated solutions approach and ability to execute lump-sum EPC projects with excellence. The benefits to both the project and to Sasol include schedule predictability, cost certainty, reduced risk, single-point accountability, optimisation of commercial processes, improved interfaces and reduced cost for the owner,&rdquo; said Fluor sub-Saharan Africa GM Alejandro Escalona.

JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Dual-listed Edenville Energy COO Mark Pryor has resigned and will be replaced by CEO Rufus Short in the interim. Pryor has also stepped down from the board with immediate effect. In a statement released Wednesday, the company said that Pryor tendered his resignation in the knowledge that his primary skills were focused on geology rather than engineering. Edenville is increasingly taking on an operational and engineering focus and will therefore need the services of an experienced openpit mining engineer.&nbsp; &quot;We wish Mark the best in his future where he is concentrating on his chosen profession of geology,&quot; said chairperson Jeff Malaihollo.

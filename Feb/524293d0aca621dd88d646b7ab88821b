Former public protector Thuli Madonsela has instructed President Jacob Zuma to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture. Chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng must decide which judge should head the commission. That is the main finding of Madonsela&rsquo;s 355-page report titled &ldquo;State of Capture&rdquo; into allegations of improper influence by the Gupta family over Zuma and his family. The North Gauteng High Court ordered the release of the report on Wednesday. &nbsp;

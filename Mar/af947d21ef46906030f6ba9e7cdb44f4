In an attempt to redefine boutique corporate space in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg, property development company Amdec has extended five office buildings in the mixed-use development by adding a new top floor to each one. &nbsp; The 4 800 m2 of new office space is designed in stylish industrial steel and glass, providing a chic executive aesthetic and great views of the precinct and its surrounding vistas. &nbsp; All five rooftop office suites will be complete before the end of the year, offering flexible space from 100 m2 to 1 500 m2, with lots of adaptability. &nbsp; Melrose Arch leasing head Renee Feeney explains that developing the new rooftop office space was undertaken in response to demand. &nbsp; &ldquo;The demand for offices at Melrose Arch continues to be strong. Its corporate appeal is enhanced by the many facilities it houses for businesses and employees. With internationally renowned hotels, as well as conference and event venues, a host of quality restaurants and ideal everyday amenities, Melrose Arch is particularly popular with multinational businesses,&rdquo; she says. &nbsp;&nbsp; There is a big representation of blue-chip companies based at Melrose Arch, including DuPont, Bidvest Group, Lonmin, MasterCard, Royal Bafokeng Holdings, Stanlib, WorleyParsons, Sasfin and Bankmed. &nbsp; &ldquo;The original design of the Melrose Arch Piazza office buildings always included a top floor. Now, we&rsquo;re thrilled to finish these buildings off with flair by adding extraordinary office spaces, unlike anything else on the market,&rdquo; Feeney notes.

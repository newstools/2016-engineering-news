Fleet and mobile asset management solutions provider MiX Telematics expects subscription revenue to increase by 5% to 6% year-on-year, to about R1.2-billion in 2017. This came on the back of a successful second quarter, which saw subscription revenue increase to R301-million, a 6% year-on-year surge, and an 8% year-on-year increase in subscribers to 585 000. This translated to an operating profit of R26-million, representing a 7% margin, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation increasing 18% to R66-million. &quot;Our second-quarter results were highlighted by improved activity from energy-sector customers late in the quarter, as well as ongoing momentum in some of our other vertical markets,&quot; said CEO Stefan Joselowitz. He added that the company continued to see that more of its customers were opting for fully bundled contracts, increasing the long-term value of these relationships. &ldquo;Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to manage our business to deliver sustained profitable growth, despite current macro headwinds in some of the geographies. &ldquo;We believe that the combination of a growing subscriber base, expanding average revenue per user from premium customers, and a continued investment in the business, positions MiX to reaccelerate performance in the second half of the year and beyond,&rdquo; said Joselowitz.

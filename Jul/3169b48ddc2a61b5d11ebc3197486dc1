RCL Foods on Wednesday joined the Food and Allied Workers Union in a march in Pietermartizburg to protest against the ongoing threats to job security as a result of what it says is the increased dumping of imported chicken on the South African market. Some 350 protesters marched from the Mayors Walk to the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature where a memorandum was handed over to Premier Willies Mchunu&rsquo;s adviser Advocate Linda Zama. RCL noted in a statement that the local industry was being forced to tighten its belt, threatening the livelihoods of chicken industry workers who face retrenchment by year-end. RCL consumer division MD Scott Pitman confirmed that the company would halve production at its Hammarsdale plant from January 2017 and that 1 350 workers had already been affected. &ldquo;It is with a heavy heart that we reduce production at our Hammarsdale plant, when it means one thing &ndash; our workforce has to shrink too, which affects breadwinners, families and entire communities,&rdquo; he said. Pitman warned that further cutbacks may also be on the cards in future. The South African Poultry Association has stated that, should the local industry be forced to shut down, the country will be at the mercy of foreign producers who can raise prices or, if better prices are offered elsewhere, switch their sales to other markets. Chicken is the main source of protein for many South African consumers and the industry that produces it provides a livelihood for over 130 000 workers.

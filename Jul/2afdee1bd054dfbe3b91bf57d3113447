International credit rating agencies have shown themselves not to be overly concerned by South African&rsquo;s &ldquo;robust&rdquo; politics, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday. &ldquo;In the end the political noise that they observe is not their main consideration,&rdquo; Ramaphosa told the National Assembly while answering questions from opposition parties. Standard &amp; Poor last week kept South Africa sovereign rating at BBB-, one notch above sub-investment status. Late last month, Fitch also maintained South Africa&rsquo;s rating at BBB- but dropped the outlook from stable to negative. It warned that political risks to standards of governance and policy-making had increased&sbquo; and would remain high for another year, until the ruling party&rsquo;s electoral conference next December, with a negative impact on macroeconomic performance.

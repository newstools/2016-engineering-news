As Gauteng grapples with water shortages amid a severe drought and evaporation owing to high summer temperatures, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) on Monday started opening up water flow from Sterkfontein dam to replenish the dangerously low levels of water at Vaal dam. A maximum of 200-million cubic metres will flow from the reserve storage at Sterkfontein dam into Nuwejaarspruit and then into the Wilge river, which will feed the Vaal over a 54-day period to ensure that the water levels of the Vaal stays at or above 25% of capacity. The Vaal River Integrated System, on which some 12-million people and industries rely for water, is currently at its lowest level of 26.6%. &ldquo;The release this morning allowed for the volume at 20 m3 a second, which will rise incrementally to reach its peak of 70 m3 a second at the beginning of December. This process will then taper off back to the initial 20 m3 a second towards the end of December when the release will be ended,&rdquo; the DWS said. Despite the expected stability from the water boost, water will remain a scarce commodity and consumers are being urged to adhere to the current strict water restrictions, continue water conservation efforts and ensure sensible water use. &ldquo;Municipalities will continue to enforce adherence to the restrictions according to their bylaws and where necessary take appropriate action,&rdquo; the DWS noted.

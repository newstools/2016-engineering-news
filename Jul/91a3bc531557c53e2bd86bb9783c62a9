The opening of the R78.5-million Swartkopfontein road and bridge linking South Africa and Botswana was officiated by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters on Monday. Speaking at the launch, Peters noted that the project had created 51 full-time jobs over the 23-month contract period and that labour was sourced from both countries, with most of the material used in construction derived from Botswana. &nbsp; &ldquo;I want to congratulate [the South African National Roads Agency] and the contractors for their delivery on a well-planned and well-executed programme. The road was upgraded from a gravel to an asphalt surface and includes the construction of the 80-m-long Notwane River bridge,&rdquo; she said. Peters added that, while the bridge was designed for a flood that would occur once in 50 years and that the design might therefore seem superfluous, considering the current drought conditions, residents no doubt &ldquo;well remember that this border post had to be closed in December 2013&rdquo;, owing to the heavy rains that caused the Notwane river to flood. &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am delighted to be here when we open a new chapter in the relationship between South Africa and Botswana and to unveil the infrastructure that will contribute to the growth of trade, commerce and regional integration,&rdquo; she said.

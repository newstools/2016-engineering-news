South Africa&#39;s agriculture ministry said on Monday the Treasury has provided R212-million ($16-million) in drought relief for animal feed to be allocated in the last three months of 2016 to help livestock farmers hard hit by a devastating drought. &quot;The drought&rsquo;s devastating effects are quite palpable and pose a risk of social upheavals. While some parts of the country are experiencing some rain, the country in its entirety is receiving below average rainfall,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.

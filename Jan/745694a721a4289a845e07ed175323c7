Italy&#39;s ENI said a final investment decision is expected from partners on Mozambique&#39;s deep-water Coral South floating liquefied natural gas project by next month, with production starting five years later. &quot;The facility will have 3.3-million tonnes of LNG production comprising gas treatment, liquification, storage and off-loading facilities,&quot; Luca Bertelli, chief exploration officer, told an African oil and gas conference on Tuesday. He also said ENI expected first oil production starting in early next year from Ghana&#39;s $7.9-billion offshore field, with gas production coming online in the second half of 2018. Bertelli said an estimated 60 000 barrels of oil will be produced by a floating production facility capable of also treating around 210-million standard cubic feet of gas as Ghana aims to become a major African oil and gas producer.

South Africa measures favourably in most indices bar economic growth, which the National Treasury has forecast will be 0.5% this year, a Moody&#39;s representative said on Tuesday. &quot;South Africa is doing relatively well in a lot of the indices when you strip out growth ... and when we look at a sovereign rating you&#39;ve got to look through the cycle,&quot; Moody&#39;s country representative Sylvia Chahonyo told a business conference. Moody&#39;s rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade with a negative outlook and is due to publish its next review in December.

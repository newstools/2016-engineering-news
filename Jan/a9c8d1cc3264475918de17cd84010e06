James Ndlovu has stepped down as CEO of the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA), effective October 31. He had served two terms as head of the organisation. TCTA chairperson Monhla Hlahla commented that Ndlovu had served the organisation with distinction. &ldquo;[He] leaves this organisation in a great state; he should be very proud of what he has achieved here,&rdquo; she added. During his tenure, the TCTA expanded its project portfolio significantly, growing from two to eleven projects, and diversified its project mix from its original focus on building large dams and inter-basin transfer pipelines to implementing small-scale community water supply schemes and the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD). Under Ndlovu&rsquo;s leadership, TCTA had also implemented an enterprise development programme, centred on enhancing the capacity of black-owned enterprises and on creating strong and sustainable communities. TCTA chief risk officer Leonard Radzuma has been appointed acting CEO until a permanent successor is appointed.

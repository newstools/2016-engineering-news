HSBC Securities on Thursday revised its growth forecast to reflect a &ldquo;stalled&rdquo; South African economy during the third quarter of the year, as opposed to its initial &ldquo;falling&rdquo; outlook, mostly as a result of more robust mining output during the period. The firm on Thursday said it expected the economy to grow by 0% in the third quarter, revised upwards from an annualised 0.7% contraction, with subdued growth expected in the final quarter of the year. It also estimated a full-year uptick of 0.3%, revised from 0.2% previously. &ldquo;After rebounding in the second quarter of 2016, we expect South Africa&rsquo;s economy to have stalled during the third quarter, as manufacturing production contracted and consumer spending showed signs of slowdown,&rdquo; said HSBC Securities economist David Faulkner. While mining continued to expand during the third quarter, supported by a 20% rise in iron-ore output, output in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12.5% of real gross domestic product (GDP), fell at an annualised pace of 5% during the third quarter, and both passenger vehicle sales and retail spending dropped. &ldquo;This would be consistent with recent data that show persistently weak confidence levels and subdued purchasing managers index readings,&rdquo; he said. HSBC continued to forecast a modest acceleration in growth to 0.6% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. GDP data is expected to be released on December 6.

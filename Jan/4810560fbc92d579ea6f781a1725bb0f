JSE-listed Emira Property Fund has completed upgrades at several key performing properties in Cape Town. &nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re strengthening our portfolio by assessing each asset for opportunities to unlock and grow value,&rdquo; says CEO Geoff Jennett. &nbsp; As a result of the upgrades, Emira&rsquo;s office vacancies in the region have improved from 7.4% in November 2015 to 5.2% in November this year. &nbsp;&nbsp; Among the assets that Emira has recently upgraded in Cape Town is Boundary Terraces, its premier Cape Town office building. Located in Newlands, Boundary Terraces is an office park with 8 000 m2 of quality offices. Its refurbishment ensures it retains its status as an A-grade business address and is appealing to its corporate tenants. &nbsp; Externally, entrances to its office blocks were emphasised and modernised with new canopies and stairs. Internally, all common areas were stripped and remodelled with a welcoming contemporary professional look.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, green technologies were introduced with light-emitting-diode lighting throughout and sensor-driven toilets that keep utility charges to a minimum. Lifts are also being replaced in all of the office blocks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Emira&rsquo;s upgrade of Boundary Terraces is strategic in that it enhances the value of the property and ensures it&rsquo;s a competitive A-grade player in the Newlands and Claremont office node,&rdquo; Jennett says. &nbsp;&nbsp; Another recent refurbishment by Emira was of the 5 000 m2 Waterside Place Tygervalley Waterfront. With high-profile blue-chip tenants the property was originally built in 2001 and acquired by Emira in mid-2014. &nbsp; In line with Emira&rsquo;s environmental policies, the project also improved the office&rsquo;s resource efficiency by adding energy efficient lighting with motion sensors to common areas, as well as automated taps and dual-flush toilets that help conserve water. &nbsp; &ldquo;Our investment in this project has created a better workspace for its occupants, one that is also more cost-efficient to occupy, while furthering Emira&rsquo;s goal of a better quality portfolio.&rdquo; &nbsp; In the Cape Town central business district, Emira recently modernised its landmark building at 9 Long street. Formerly known as Wesbank House, on the corner of Long and Riebeek streets, its old 1980s concrete fa&ccedil;ade was repainted and modernised with stunning glass and louvre finishes. The building is now fully-let and occupied by two tenants. The building also extends along Long street to the corner of Waterkant or &lsquo;fan mile&rsquo; corner where it is home to the City Bowl&rsquo;s first Dunkin Donuts. &nbsp; In support of inner-city regeneration and community upliftment, Emira has collaborated with Cape Town-based charity U-Turn to open its first inner-city shop at 9 Long street.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emira&rsquo;s latest Cape Town project is about to begin at 80 Strand street. The B-Grade office tower will be renewed back to its former A-Grade glory with a complete overhaul. &nbsp; The company&rsquo;s assets include 144 properties valued at R12.9-billion. Emira is also internationally diversified through its direct interest in ASX-listed GOZ valued at R940.4-million.

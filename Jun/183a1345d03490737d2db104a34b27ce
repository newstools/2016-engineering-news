As many as 1 500 houses in Risinga View village, near Giyani in Limpopo, have been connected to the grid allowing them to have electricity for the for the first time, Eskom said on Tuesday. The project at Risinga View started in July 2016 and took four months to complete. It was energised from the Giyani Substation, feeder Mangombe 22 kV. Eskom said its customer service division will conduct customer education in the area to ensure that the new customers are well-versed in the safe use of electricity. Newly-connected customers and local Traditional Leader, Joel Chabalala expressed their gratitude to Eskom. Chabalala promised they would be good Eskom ambassadors and they would do their bit to save and use electricity efficiently. Eskom has designated Giyani Hub, Shop A1, at Masingita Shopping Complex to assist customers from Risinga with their electricity related queries. &ldquo;We also urge our new customers to be on the lookout for illegal connections and those who tamper with metres. These are criminal acts which rob communities of a stable electricity supply. Should the community witness such acts, we urge them to send an anonymous SMS to crime line on 32211 to report them&rdquo; said Eskom in a statement.

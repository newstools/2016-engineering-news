South Africa&rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a meagre 0.2% in the third quarter of 2016, Statistics South Africa announced on Tuesday. The growth recorded was significantly lower than the previous quarter&rsquo;s 3.3% and 0.1 percentage point lower than the 0.3% recorded in the third quarter of 2015. &ldquo;The main contributors to growth were the mining and quarrying sector, finance, real estate and business services and general government services,&rdquo; Statistics SA deputy director general Joe de Beer said at a media briefing at Parliament. The growth in the mining and quarrying sector, which expanded by 5.1%, was attributed to higher production in the mining of particularly iron ore. Four industries &ndash; agriculture, forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity, gas and water; and trade, catering and accommodation - contracted. The agricultural, forestry and fisheries sector has been in decline for seven consecutive quarters. &ldquo;The contraction in the agricultural sector specifically could be attributed to the drought,&rdquo; De Beer said, &ldquo;but indications are that the drought experienced in 2016 is less severe than in 2015.&rdquo; Expenditure on GDP grew by 0.5%. The increase was by and large as a result of expenditure in health services, which increased by 10%. Government final consumption expenditure increased by 2.1%, with household consumption expanding by 2.6%. Net exports in the third quarter contributed negatively to total expenditure on GDP, falling by 26.4%, mainly because of lower exports of precious metals and transport equipment. Imports also decreased by 4.9%, mainly because of subdued imports of machinery and electrical equipment. The revised GDP growth figure Statistics SA recorded year-on-year for the third quarter was 0.7%.

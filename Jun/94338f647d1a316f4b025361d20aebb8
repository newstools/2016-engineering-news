The study programme offered by GCU includes a formal qualification in railway operations management. The qualifications include Bachelor of Science degrees in railway operations management, Diplomas of Higher Education and Certificates of Higher Education. &ldquo;I congratulate our latest graduates and am proud that the partnership between GCU, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) and TFR continues to develop,&rdquo; said Gillies.

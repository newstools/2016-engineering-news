As the World Trade Organisation (WTO) prepares to start the process for the appointment of a new director-general on December 1, WTO director-general Roberto Azev&ecirc;do, whose term ends on August 31, 2017, has confirmed his willingness to serve a second term. In a letter to WTO general council chairperson Harald Neple, Azev&ecirc;do noted that he would be ready to serve a second term, allowing him the opportunity to build on the work he has achieved since first being appointed in September 2013. &ldquo;I believe we have achieved a great deal over this period. The coming years will present further opportunities to strengthen the global trading system, particularly for developing and least-developed countries,&rdquo; he stated. Azev&ecirc;do further noted that, during his tenure, the WTO demonstrated that it could deliver major negotiated outcomes; he cited the Ministerial Conferences held in Indonesia&rsquo;s Bali in 2013 and in Nairobi, Kenya in 2015. &ldquo;In addition, we have taken steps to strengthen the dispute settlement system and increase its resource allocation,&rdquo; he said, adding that his team had also overseen the expansion of the WTO by welcoming five new. Azev&ecirc;do noted that there remained important things to do to continue developing all areas of the WTO&rsquo;s work, including capacity building. The WTO needs to follow certain procedure when appointing a new director-general, including allowing members one month to nominate candidates and provide supporting information. Following that, the organisation will&nbsp; meet with the candidates and a subsequent consultation process to March 31, 2017 conducted by Neple, will take place. The appointment will be settled by no later than May 31, 2017.

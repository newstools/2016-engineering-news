Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has filed papers to join proceedings in the application to interdict the release of the Public Protector&#39;s &quot;state capture&quot; report. The matter is due to be heard on November 1, after it was postponed in the High Court in Pretoria in October. President Jacob Zuma is seeking to delay the publication of the state capture report, which was compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. He has since indicated that he would seek a postponement when he goes to court on Tuesday. Zwane joined Co-operative Governance Minister Des Van Rooyen, who initially sought to oppose the release of the report in October, then withdrew his application, only to reinstate it over the weekend. Zwane said he had no choice but to enter the fray. &quot;The Public Protector cannot confirm or deny if the report, which is now alleged to be in final form, makes any adverse findings against the Minister,&quot; his department said in a statement. &quot;It is the minister&rsquo;s submission that the report was hastily prepared without due regard to his constitutional rights.&quot; Van Rooyen launched his application because he felt he had not been given sufficient time to respond to the preliminary report.

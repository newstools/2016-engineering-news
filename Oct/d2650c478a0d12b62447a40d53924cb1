The one-year-old Telkom spin-off integrated communications company Openserve and information and communications technology solutions provider Huawei have teamed up to deploy a high-speed fibre packet and optical transport network. This was a first step in Openserve&rsquo;s ambitions of restructuring its network architecture, with initial results revealing a seven-fold increase in the speed of fibre deployment. The core network deployment, which started in Gauteng, was currently being rolled out nationally, with Openserve now investigating future services leveraging the future-oriented Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture based on Internet protocol and optical synergy, said Openserve CEO Alphonzo Samuels. Openserve, which is currently in the process finalisation phase before implementation, will now be able to respond to the exponential growth in demand for data services across South Africa. &ldquo;With the quick service provisioning and smart management that SDN brings, we can quickly develop more innovative services to meet various customer requirements, improving our competitive position in South Africa&rsquo;s telecoms market,&rdquo; Samuels pointed out. The network will support 8 Tb/s per fibre, with one pair of fibre supporting 400 000 families with 20 Mb/s bandwidth a family concurrently.

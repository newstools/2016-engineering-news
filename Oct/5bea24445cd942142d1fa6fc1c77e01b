South Africa&#39;s factory output was flat in September from a year ago, data showed on Thursday, contrasting strong second quarter economic growth and increasing the risk of a credit rating downgrade. Separately, mining output increased by 3.4% year-on-year in September. But analysts said this was not sustainable as commodity prices struggle to recover. Manufacturing output was flat at 0% year-on-year in September, after expanding by 2.2% in August, Statistics South Africa said. Economists polled by Reuters forecast a 0.1% year-on-year increase in manufacturing volumes. On a month-on-month basis, factory production was up 1.5% but edged down 1.3% in the three months to September compared with the previous three months. Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note that retail figures due next week would give an better idea of how the economy was performing but &quot;the available survey data suggest that consumer spending probably remained weak.&quot; The economy expanded by 3.3% in the second quarter of 2016 after a contraction in the first quarter, and Treasury sees it expanding by 0.5% this year. The central bank has said weak growth and political disturbances risked South Africa&#39;s credit rating. Ratings agencies are due to review South Africa&#39;s rating before the end of the year. Moody&#39;s rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, while Fitch and S&amp;P Global Ratings have it just a step above &quot;junk&quot;.

Contract services group CSG is transferring to the main board of the JSE, ten years after embarking on its AltX listing, to leverage better benefits of a higher profile, greater coverage by analysts and enhanced opportunities for institutions to invest in the company. The company, through organic and acquisitive growth, expanded its revenue from R192-million in 2006 to nearly R1.3-billion in 2016, while also boasting a net asset value of R346-million. &ldquo;The continued growth strategy is to expand acquisitively into a well-recognised, leading brand in all its chosen specialist outsource sectors and increase the basket of complementary services being offered by targeting successful, well-established businesses with strong management teams, [and] offering clients a range of specialised services in one group,&rdquo; CSG CEO Pieter Dry said in a statement on Friday. CSG, which had, earlier this year, privately placed 29-million shares and increased its liquidity and shareholder spread, reported headline earnings a share of 20.22c, earnings a share of 20.01c and profit after tax of R85.58-million in 2016.

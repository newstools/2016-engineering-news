Radwin, the global broadband wireless provider, on Thursday said it had installed a state-of-the-art wireless video surveillance network for the Windhoek Police Department as part of Namibia&rsquo;s vision to be the safest African country by 2020. Radwin&rsquo;s point-to-multipoint and point-to-point systems were installed in dozens of crime hot-spots throughout the city to transmit high-quality video from cameras directly to police headquarters, enabling on-the-spot detection and response. Windhoek City Police spokesperson Cillie Auala said the legacy network had been upgraded because &ldquo;it did not meet our requirements for high-capacity transmission and our safety and performance standards&rdquo;. &ldquo;Now that we are using Radwin&rsquo;s systems, we are getting highest video transmission quality with zero video pixilation and low jitter, which is vital for our mission-critical operations.&rdquo; Rampoint Communications MD Andre Delport said: &ldquo;From our extensive experience, Radwin&rsquo;s solutions operate in the toughest urban environments, overcoming interference and line-of-sight obstacles to deliver superior video performance.&rdquo; Radwin Africa GM Peter Turvey added that with the wireless broadband solutions, the city&rsquo;s police forces and first responders can monitor and address unfolding situations in real-time, and use high-definition video surveillance footage, enhancing the safety and security of citizens in Windhoek.

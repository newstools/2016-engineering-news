Wage negotiations in South Africa&rsquo;s retail motor and component manufacturing industries are still ongoing. The current three-year wage agreement lapsed at the end of August. The negotiations involve the Fuel Retailers Association, the Retail Motor Industry Organisation, National Employers Association of South Africa, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and Motor Industry Staff Association. Despite the delay in wrapping up negotiations, the National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers (Naacam) executive director Renai Moothilal is upbeat that the process will be completed without any labour action. &ldquo;The negotiations are at a very advanced stage and parties are convinced that a positive outcome will be reached in the coming days. South African vehicle manufacturers signed a new three-year wage deal with Numsa in September. The new deal sees workers receive a 10% raise in 2016 and an 8% increase in each of the following two years. The previous rounds of wage negotiations in the manufacturing and motor retail sectors in 2013 resulted in two protracted strikes. &nbsp;

JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Platinum mining company Impala Platinum (Implats) is disposing of its 65% interest in Impala Chrome, a chrome beneficiation operation that produces 200 000 t of chrome concentrate a year by processing four-million tonnes of tailings a year. As announced in a newspaper advertisement, Implats&rsquo; shareholding will be sold in a competitive tender process. Impala Chrome&rsquo;s operations, located at Implats&rsquo; Rustenburg mine in South Africa&rsquo;s North West province, are operated by Chrome Traders Processing, a 30% shareholder in Impala Chrome. The remaining 5% of Impala Chrome&rsquo;s shares are held by a special purpose vehicle for certain land rights holders in the area surrounding the Impala Chrome operations. Implats wants to dispose of its interest because it views the asset as noncore. The operation has a substantial supply of chromite from the upper group two ore that will be mined by Impala over its life-of-mine.

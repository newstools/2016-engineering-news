JSE-listed Sasol has entered into several hedges to mitigate specific financial risks in the 2017 financial year, which ends June 30, 2017. The move, part of a board-approved policy, includes hedges against the downside risk in the crude oil price to &ldquo;increase the stability and predictability of Sasol&rsquo;s cash flows&rdquo;. During the second quarter to December, Sasol entered into oil put options, which provided an average Brent crude oil price floor of $48.68/bl, net of costs, for about 7.6-million barrels. The company also entered into put options for the third quarter and a part of the fourth quarter for an average Brent crude oil price floor of $47.06/bl for about 16.8-million barrels. &ldquo;We are currently reviewing other commodity and currency hedges and, should we enter into material hedges, an appropriate announcement will be made,&rdquo; Sasol concluded.

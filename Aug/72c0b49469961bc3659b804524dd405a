JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) &ndash; Diversified mining company South32 has opened a seawater desalination plant at its Hillside Aluminium smelter in Richards&rsquo;s Bay to mitigate against the drought experienced in the KwaZulu-Natal province in the last few years. The R74-million desalination plant will allow South32 to maintain operations during a time of drought, which has resulted in the implementation of stringent water restrictions. Desalination was identified as the preferred alternative as it will not only supply adequate water to ensure operations are maintained, but also supplement municipal water supply in times of critical shortage, South32 Africa president Mike Fraser said in a release to Creamer Media&rsquo;s Mining Weekly Online. Construction of the province&#39;s first desalination plant began in April, following approval from the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs.

Transnet Freight Rail (TFR), in conjunction with ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA), Barloworld and Grindrod Logistics, have launched a &lsquo;steel hub&rsquo; at TFR&rsquo;s Elandsfontein yard to migrate steel volumes that are being transported by road back onto rail. Two years after first deliberations, last week the first train travelled from AMSA&rsquo;s plant, in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal, to the steel hub/distribution centre, in Elandsfontein, south-east of Johannesburg. &ldquo;The strategic importance of the steel hub is that it is an execution of the back to rail strategy, which will strengthen customer relationships and ensure long-term contracting with . . . AMSA,&rdquo; TFR said in a statement on Monday. The rail parastatal provides AMSA a &ldquo;dedicated service&rdquo;, with dedicated resources and time slots on agreed upon days, with the railed steel then transported by Barloworld-managed road cartage trucks for delivery to customers. The steel hub in Elandsfontein is intended as an interim distribution centre over the next two to three years, with a permanent distribution centre being built at Grindrod&rsquo;s premises, in Denver. In addition to reduced carbon emissions and road congestion, TFR pointed to reduced lead times for AMSA&rsquo;s customers domestically and cross border, while stimulating growth in market share of outbound steel on rail from the current 13%, or 400 000 t, in 2016/17 to 34%, or one-million tons, in the 2017/18 financial year. &ldquo;It is guaranteed to capture and increase the steel portfolio market share on finished steel products, which is considered rail-friendly traffic,&rdquo; TFR commented.
